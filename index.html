        <dl class="dl-horizontal">
            <dt>Sports</dt><dd>I have always done sports. Lots of sports! I used to play competitive <strong>tennis</strong> and currently I keep playing for fun. I am really keen on <strong>mountain biking</strong>, <strong>snowboarding</strong> and I also go to the <strong>gym</strong> 4 times a week. I also <strong>swim</strong> at least once a week.</dd>
            <dt>Photography</dt><dd>I love photography. Both to make it (or at least try to) and also watch what others have done.</dd>
            <dt>Music</dt><dd>I am a big rock music fan. If I have to be precise, the genres I listen to are metal, hadrcore, neo metal and other related ones. My favourite bands include <strong>Slipknot</strong>, <strong>Stone Sour</strong>, <strong>Korn</strong>, <strong>Metallica</strong>, <strong>Limp Bizkit</strong>, <strong>Attack Attack!</strong>, <strong>Mudvayne</strong>, <strong>Machine Head</strong> and many many many more. There is always a new band I discover or I am in a mood for. I don't limit myself only on rock/metal - I like all kinds of music, but these are my preferred types while I work and try to concentrate or I need some motivation. I play the acoustic guitar and I still have lots to learn, but it helps me relax and have some fun.</dd>
